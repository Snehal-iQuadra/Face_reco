# Face Recognition Project

This project implements a face recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The system includes multiple scripts for different functionalities such as capturing frames, recognizing faces from live video feed, and processing video files.


## File Descriptions

- `frame.py`: Captures images of a user's face and stores them in a directory for future recognition.
- `frame.py`: Captures frames and recognizes a user's face based on stored images.
- `frameauto.py`: Automatically captures and recognizes a user's face at regular intervals.
- `nocam.py`: Recognizes a user's face without displaying the camera feed.
- `vid.py`: Processes a video file to recognize faces within the video.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`:Download and place the Haar Cascade XML file in the project directory:
    - [Haar Cascade XML file](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
    - or it is included in the repository for you to use
